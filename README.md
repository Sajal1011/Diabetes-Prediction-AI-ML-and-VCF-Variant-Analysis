# AI-Powered Diabetes Prediction using ML Models

This project applies machine learning algorithms to the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset to predict the likelihood of diabetes. It includes data preprocessing, model training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM), evaluation, and visualizations.

## Features
- Data cleaning and EDA
- Model training and comparison
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC
- Python libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## How to Run
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run `notebooks/diabetes_analysis.ipynb` for full workflow

## Dataset
PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset (available in `dataset/diabetes.csv`)
